## ðŸ§  Concepts & Code Examples

### ðŸ”¹ Linear Regression

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create model
lr = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
X = df[['attribute_1', 'attribute_2']]
Y = df['target_attribute']
lr.fit(X, Y)

# Predict
Y_hat = lr.predict(X)

# Coefficients
coeff = lr.coef_
intercept = lr.intercept_
